# The idea here is that a new requid shall be for the full test suite, however
# many domains make it up.

# When a start test for a domain is received, it shall be compared against the 
# list of requirements for the full test suite.

# In this way all specified requirements for a test suite can be 'checked off'
# against the known list.

# This service allows the specification of a requirement for the test suite.
